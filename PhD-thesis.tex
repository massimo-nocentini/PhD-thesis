\chapter*{Abstract}

The subject of the thesis concerns the study of infinite sequences, in one or
two dimensions, supporting the theoretical aspects with systems for symbolic
and logic computation. In particular, in the thesis some sequences related to
Riordan arrays are examined from both an algebraic and combinatorial points of
view and also by using approaches usually applied in numerical analysis. 

Another part concerns sequences that count the enumeration of particular 
combinatorial objects, such as trees, polyominoes, and lattice paths,
generated by symbolic and certified computation; moreover, tiling problems
and backtracking techniques are studied in depth and enumeration of recursive
structures are also given. 

We propose a preliminary suite of tools to interact with the Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, providing a crawling facility to download
sequences recursively according to their cross references, pretty printing them
and, finally, drawing graphs representing their connections.

In the context of automatic proof derivation, an extension to an automatic
theorem prover is proposed to support the relational programming paradigm.
This allows us to encode facts about combinatorial objects and to enumerate the
corresponding languages by producing certified theorems at the same time. 

As a constant exercise, we provide many chunks of code written using functional
programming languages; our focus is to support theoretical derivations using
sound, clear and elegant implementations to check their validity.
